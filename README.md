Electrical and PCB Design Engineer, Embedded Systems, ESP32, STM32

Hi! I’m Souhaib Cherbal, Master’s in EMC (France) and Electrical Engineering diploma (Algeria). I specialize in custom PCB design for embedded systems using KiCad & EasyEDA, with multi-layer layouts, power management, and sensor integration. I’ve built PCBs for ESP32/STM32-based systems and developed firmware for real-time control. Let’s create reliable and optimized hardware together!
