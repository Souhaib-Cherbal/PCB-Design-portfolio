## About Me

I'm Souhaib Cherbal, an electrical engineer specializing in PCB design and embedded systems. I hold a Master's degree in EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) from France and a degree in Electrical Engineering from Algeria. I work primarily with KiCad and EasyEDA, designing everything from simple Arduino-compatible boards to complex multi-layer industrial controllers.

This repository showcases the hardware projects I've worked on, ranging from IoT devices to industrial automation systems.

### What I Focus On
- Custom PCB design and layout
- ESP32 and STM32-based systems
- Power electronics and motor control
- IoT and home automation hardware
- EMC-compliant design
- DFM optimization for manufacturing

## My Design Workflow

**Requirements → Schematic → Layout → Validation → Manufacturing**

I start by understanding what you need, then move through circuit design, PCB layout with proper stackup planning, and thorough verification before generating production files. I work closely with manufacturers to ensure smooth fabrication and assembly.

## Services

I'm available for PCB design projects including:
- Custom board design from concept to production
- Schematic capture and component selection
- Multi-layer layouts with signal integrity optimization
- EMC compliance consulting
- Design reviews and optimization
- Prototype development and testing support
